# Mutation Calling Software Links

When browsing the internet, I found [this guide](https://github.com/tinyheero/variant_calling_in_cancer_genomes_seminar), which seemed pretty solid. 

- [Lofreq](http://csb5.github.io/lofreq/commands/)
- [Mutect](http://archive.broadinstitute.org/cancer/cga/mutect_run)
- [Strelka](https://github.com/Illumina/strelka/blob/master/docs/userGuide/README.md)

## GATK Random Links
- [Commands for recallibrating .bam files](http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/2801/howto-recalibrate-base-quality-scores-run-bqsr)

## SNP files
These were actually specified in the supplement of the main manuscript.

Here's where I got one file from:

```
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/organisms/mouse_10090/VCF/genotype/SC_MOUSE_GENOMES.genotype.vcf.gz
```

Another one:

```
wget ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1303-SNPs_Indels-GRCm38/mgp.v3.snps.rsIDdbSNPv137.vcf.gz
```

Then we had to reprocess by appending `chr` to the chromosome names, compress, and then reindex--

```
zcat mgp.v3.snps.rsIDdbSNPv137.vcf.gz | awk '{if($0 !~ /^#/) print "chr"$0; else print $0}' | bgzip > chrdbSNP.vcf.gz
zcat SC_MOUSE_GENOMES.genotype.vcf.gz | awk '{if($0 !~ /^#/) print "chr"$0; else print $0}' | bgzip > chrMouseSNPs.vcf.gz
```

Rather than doing `vcftools` filtering, I created a simple positional index of where common variants occurred and then
did filtering in `R` using this input file:

```
zcat chrMouseSNPs.vcf.gz chrdbSNP.vcf.gz | cut -f 1,2 | sort -gk 1,2  | uniq > allMouseSNPloci.bed
```
